Hello my name is Caleb Kim, a junior at Wake Forest University pursuiing a bachelors degree in computer science, accompanied by a minor in statistics. This GitHub repository is a compilation of my coding journey over the years. From collaborative group projects in JavaScript to solo lab assignments in Java and crafting user-interactive games with Python, I'm always eager to expand my computer science knowledge and enhance my coding skills.
