# ProjectPortfolio
Hello my name is Caleb Kim, a junior at Wake Forest University pursuiing a bachelors degree in computer science, accompanied by a minor in statistics. This GitHub repository is a compilation of my coding journey over the years. From collaborative group projects in JavaScript to solo lab assignments in Java and crafting user-interactive games with Python, I'm always eager to expand my computer science knowledge and enhance my coding skills.

Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL

Python (Summer 2023): During the summer of 2023, I undertook a comprehensive online course on Udemy.com, dedicated to mastering the Python programming language. Throughout the duration of the program, I not only acquired proficiency in Python but also successfully executed two significant milestone projects to showcase my coding abilities. For Milestone Project 1, I implemented a user-interactive Tic-Tac-Toe video game, demonstrating my adeptness in creating functional and engaging applications. In Milestone Project 2, I leveraged my understanding of classes, tuples, and functions to develop a sophisticated Blackjack game, incorporating artificial intelligence for a challenging player-versus-CPU experience.
