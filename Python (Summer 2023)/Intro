Python (Summer 2023): During the summer of 2023, I undertook a comprehensive online course on Udemy.com, dedicated to mastering the Python programming language. Throughout the duration of the program, I not only acquired proficiency in Python but also successfully executed two significant milestone projects to showcase my coding abilities. For Milestone Project 1, I implemented a user-interactive Tic-Tac-Toe video game, demonstrating my adeptness in creating functional and engaging applications. In Milestone Project 2, I leveraged my understanding of classes, tuples, and functions to develop a sophisticated Blackjack game, incorporating artificial intelligence for a challenging player-versus-CPU experience.
