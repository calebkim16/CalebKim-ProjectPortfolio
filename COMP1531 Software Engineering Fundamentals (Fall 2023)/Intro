COMP1531 Software Engineering Fundamentals (Fall 2023): During my academic tenure at the University of New South Wales in New South Wales, Australia, I actively engaged in the COMP1531 Software Engineering Fundamentals course. This comprehensive program delved into essential software engineering principles, agile methodologies, and the orchestration of proficient teams to ensure the development of accurate and functional products.

Project: In collaboration with a team of four, I participated in a major project that entailed the analysis, design, construction, and deployment of a web-based application similar to Kahoot.it. Our successful execution of this endeavor underscored our adept utilization of pivotal tools, including GitLab and Microsoft Teams, as well as our commitment to fostering effective communication within the team.
